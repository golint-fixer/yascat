# Simple Bot for Discord - Yascat
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doriable/yascat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doriable/yascat)

## Introduction

I wanted to learn more Go and create a chatbot for our Discord server. This is a very simple chat bot that I am building upon.

## Commands

`!yas` : yascat will respond with `yas`

`@yascat !findgif <gif_query_strings>` : yascat will search giphy and return a gif (if one exists) for that query string and post it in the chat

## WIP

This chat bot is currently WIP and is mostly a Go learning exercise for me, but if anyone has any suggestions for yascat, feel free to get in touch with me. Thanks!
