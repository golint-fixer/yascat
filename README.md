# Simple Bot for Discord - Yascat
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doriable/discord-yascat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doriable/discord-yascat)

## Introduction

I wanted to learn more Go and create a chatbot for our Discord server. This is a very simple chat bot that I am building upon.

## Commands

`!yas` : yascat will respond with `yas`
`!bonglord` : yascat will respond with `I'm the bonglord`

## WIP

This chat bot is currently WIP and is mostly a Go learning exercise for me, but if anyone has any suggestions for yascat, feel free to get in touch with me. Thanks!
